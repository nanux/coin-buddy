        background: 'Orator and self-appointed arbiter of Roman rule of law Marcus Cicero sometimes defended and sometimes assailed Caesar’s position in the Senate. His brother Quintus was a legate in Caesar’s army between 54 and 52BC, and that must have influenced his positions regarding Caesar and the war in Gaul. Exiled in 58 BC, restored in 57, sometimes useful to Caesar and Pompey together, sometimes harmful to each, Cicero personified the complexity of Roman politics even more than he appeared a litmus test of Caesar’s strength in Rome.'
