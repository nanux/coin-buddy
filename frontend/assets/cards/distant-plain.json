In strict dollar terms, it might have been cheaper for the Afghan Government, with support from Coalition nation governments, to simply buy opium from farmers and either destroy it or process it into morphine and other drugs for legitimate medical use, as done in India. The latter measure might even have been profitable. However, these expedients would not address the deeper issue of the narcotics trade, addiction among the civilian population, corruption, and the great distortions that opium production as a cash crop produced in Afghanistan\u2019s largely agricultural economy."
