                    composed of Indian soldiers and British
                    officers. Its primary duty was the defense of India, but it also sent significant

                    Background. The end of World War I
                    brought an end to the Ottoman Empire,
                    once the largest and most powerful
                    Muslim empire in history. The last Ottoman Sultan was also the last Caliph,
                    or political ruler of all Muslims. In India,
                    some in the Muslim community supported the pan-Islamic aims of the Khilafat movement to return a Caliph to
                    power, while others looked inward in
                    support of secular, Indian nationalism.
